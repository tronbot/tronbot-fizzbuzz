Feature: Question 3 - Power of 2
	Implement a method / function that takes an int n as input and returns a
	boolean, whose value is true, if and only if n is a power of 2. Pseudocode is
	sufficient. Implement a second algorithm for the same problem.
	Scenario: Check if number is power of 2
		When input number as 90900 returns
		When input number as 1048576 returns
		When input number as 5900 returns
		When input number as 64 returns
